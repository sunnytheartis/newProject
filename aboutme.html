            <p>Suspects seems to go by Sunny. They create artwork for citizens that seemingly provoke feeling.
                Not much is known about where they started in their artistic process or why people have chosen to be interested in the designs, none the less,
                it is definally not going to be good for us if we keep letting them build traction and gaining influence.
                Suspect is unpredictible! They do not seem to have a set schedule so it is hard to pin point specific locations the suspect will appear. Here are a list of food places they like along with what the suspect orders.
